# La Widgeterie — Sales Performance & Data Storytelling Project
## Problem Statement

La Widgeterie, a mid-sized manufacturing company, experienced rapid growth across multiple regions, years, and distribution partners. While sales data existed, it was fragmented across dozens of Excel sheets, inconsistent in structure, and difficult to interpret.
Management needed clear, trustworthy insights—but the raw data was too messy to support confident decision-making.

This project addresses a common real-world challenge: turning complex, imperfect data into clear business insight.

## Objective

The goal of this project was to build an automated, end-to-end data analysis workflow that:

Consolidates multi-year, multi-sheet sales data

Cleans and standardizes inconsistent values

Enriches transactions with geographic context

Produces executive-ready insights and visuals

Most importantly, the project focuses on data storytelling: choosing analyses and visualizations that communicate meaning, not just numbers.

## Approach
1. Data Preparation

Loaded five years of transactional data from Excel workbooks (60 monthly sheets).

Standardized product names and corrected hidden missing values.

Reconstructed missing sales values using economically sound logic (average unit price by product and time period).

2. Data Enrichment

Merged transactions with a reference table of wholesalers to assign regions and geographic coordinates.

Ensured all analysis could be reliably repeated without manual steps.

3. Analysis Design (Story-First Thinking)

Rather than plotting “everything,” the analysis was structured around business questions:

Which products and wholesalers truly drive performance?

How concentrated is revenue (Pareto effects)?

Are top performers dominant or closely contested?

Do seasonal patterns meaningfully impact sales?

Visualization choices were made deliberately (e.g., stacked vs grouped bars, line charts, maps) to avoid misleading comparisons and highlight decision-relevant patterns.

## Outputs

The project produces a fully automated Excel report and visual assets including:

Top SKUs by Year — highlighting competition and revenue concentration.

Top Wholesalers by Year — showing shifting leaders and distribution dynamics.

Regional Sales Map — geographic context using a bubble map with a calibrated color scale.

Seasonality Analysis — month-by-month trends across all years.

Each output is designed to be understandable without reading the code.

## Key Insights

Top performers are often closely matched, making context essential—“winner-only” charts can hide important dynamics.

Revenue concentration varies by year, revealing potential dependency risks on a small number of products or partners.

Geographic performance is uneven, suggesting targeted regional strategies rather than uniform expansion.

Seasonal effects exist but are subtler than expected, reinforcing the need for data-driven planning over assumptions.

## Why This Project Matters

This project demonstrates not just technical skills, but the ability to:

Handle messy, real-world data

Make thoughtful analytical choices

Communicate insights clearly to non-technical stakeholders

In short: it shows how data becomes decisions.
